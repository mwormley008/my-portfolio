                <strong><small>I love to learn!</strong></small>
                <p>I currently have a 480 day Duolingo streak and a 210 day Anki streak. I'm learning Russian in Duo and Anki, and when I have more free time I spend it on learning new things! I love to read and listening to audiobooks. I'm always trying to sharpen my mind. I live with my girlfriend and her son, who both speak Russian, so I'm trying to catch up with them!</p>

                <p> My other hobbies are investing and personal finance, I play ultimate frisbee, and one day I want to max an Old School Runescape account but I don't even play the game currently because life gets in the way! I started typing in Dvorak in July and I'm up to 86 wpm lifetime average on Coderacer, and I'd love to race anyone! When I was a bit younger I really enjoyed traveling, but that hasn't been my facus lately, but I'll actually be flying back from Hawaii the first day of Boot Camp!</p>

                <strong><small>Time to make a change</strong></small>
                <p>I've always loved working with computers and I'm ready to make a change. I was doing some self-teaching starting the past summer, but I realized that joining a boot camp was going to make a big difference to me in how quickly I could transition to full-time, so that's my goal now!</p>
